					<br/><br/>

					<br/><br/>

					<br/><br/>
					<strong>Tax deductions and receipts</strong>

					<strong>8.8</strong>&emsp; In some cases donations made to an Agency will be tax deductible, but in other cases the donation may not be tax deductible.
					<br/><br/>
					<strong>8.9</strong>&emsp; It is your responsibility to confirm whether an Agency has the appropriate legal status to allow you to claim a tax deduction. It is also your responsibility to determine whether any perks received in exchange for your donation will prevent you from claiming your donation as a tax deduction.
